            <!-- <p>While your antivirus software means well, it might misidentify Bail Bloc as malware. In recent weeks covert cryptocurrency mining software has been deployed without user consent. You might need to temporarily disable your antivirus software.</p>

            <p>Bail Bloc is not a virus! The app is completely legal, safe, and private, and allows you to keep working as normal.</p>

            <p>If you still have concerns or questions, <a href="https://github.com/thenewinquiry/bailbloc">view our open-source code</a> or email us at <a href="mailto:bailbloc@thenewinquiry.com">bailbloc@thenewinquiry.com</a></p>

<p><h2>FAQ</h2></p>

<p><h3>Does this cost more to run in electricity than it generates in revenue for bail?</h3></p>

<p>Unlike Bitcoin and other popular crypto coins, which require a great deal of energy to mine, Monero is ASIC-resistant, which means that it requires a comparatively negligible amount of energy, and is therefore cost efficient.</p> 

<p><h3>Is there a command-line version of the software available?</p></h3>

<p>There is. Check out our <a href="https://github.com/thenewinquiry/bailbloc">GitHub repository</a>.</p>

<p><h3>How do I uninstall it?</p></h3>

<p>On macOS: Bailbloc is running in your menu bar, at the top of your screen. Find the icon, click it, and hit Quit. Then drag the app from your Applications folder into the Recycling bin.</p>

<p>On Windows: Bailbloc is running in your system tray, at the bottom right of your screen. Find the icon, right click it, and hit Quit. Then go to Add/Remove programs from the start menu as usual.</p>
