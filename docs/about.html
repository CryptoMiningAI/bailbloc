      <h3>VOLUNTEER YOUR COMPUTER'S SPARE POWER TO GET PEOPLE OUT OF JAIL</h3>
<br/>
    
      <p>

        <strong>Here’s how it works:</strong> When you download the app, a small part of your computer's unused processing power is redirected toward mining a popular cryptocurrency called <a href="https://getmonero.org/">Monero</a>, which is secure, private, and untraceable.  At the end of every month, we exchange the Monero for US dollars and donate the earnings to the <a href="http://www.thebronxfreedomfund.org/">Bronx Freedom Fund</a>.
      </p>

      <p>100% of the currency your computer generates is used by the Bronx Freedom Fund to post bail<sup><a href="#bail" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="footnotes-ref">1</a></sup>  for low-income people detained in the Bronx and Queens.</p>

      

      <p>
        <strong>Bail funds accumulate:</strong> Bail funds are “revolving,” which means they’re returned to their source when a defendant makes trial—which, for clients of the Bronx Freedom Fund, happens 97% of the time.
      </p>

     
      <p>
        Most Bail Bloc users can expect to generate around $3 to $5 per month. It might not seem like much, but because of revolving bail, it adds up quickly.

        HOW BAIL WORKS
      </h1>
      <h3>BAIL HAS NO REAL JUSTIFICATION, BUT IT PUTS REAL PEOPLE IN JAIL.</h3>
      <br/>

      <p>The American criminal justice system is unequipped to try the number of defendants it charges. </p>

      <p>70% of people in jail have not yet been convicted of any crime. Bail streamlines mass incarceration by functionally relieving courts of the burden of litigation. Prosecutors and judges work in concert to coerce low-income defendants to accept plea deals in exchange for their release. That means they forfeit their right to be tried before a jury, are never allowed to argue their case, and can never be found innocent.</p>

      <p>Put simply, these defendants are found guilty of poverty.</p>

      <p>Bail is a means to an end, and the end is mass incarceration.</p>

      <p>If just a small percentage of defendants typically coerced into pleading guilty stood trial, the court system that facilitates mass incarceration would cease to function.</p>

<br/>

      <h1>WHAT IS CRYPTOCURRENCY?</h1>
      <h3>
        CRYPTOCURRENCY ISN'T REAL MONEY, BUT IT HAS REAL-WORLD EXCHANGE VALUE.
      </h3>
      <br/>

      <p>
        Just as the US Treasury prints money to infuse into the economy, cryptocurrency is generated "out of nowhere" through an arbitrary process. But where the US Treasury needs a minting machine, all miners need is computing power. Cryptocurrencies are generated through users running software to solve difficult computational problems, in a process known as "mining." When a problem is solved, the user is rewarded by a decentralized cryptocurrency network with units of that cryptocurrency. If enough users mine for the same cryptocurrency, it begins to have an exchange value.<sup><a href="#monero" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="footnotes-ref">2</a></sup>
      </p>
      
       
<br/>
      <h1>OUR GOAL</h1>
      <h3>
        BAIL BLOC IS DESIGNED TO PUT PRESSURE ON COURTS AND BRING AN END TO BAIL.
      </h3>
<br/>
      <p>
        With enough downloads, Bail Bloc has the potential release a critical mass of defendants from pre-trial jail. If just a small percentage of these defendants elect to stand trial instead of pleading out, the courts would be overwhelmed to the point of atrophy and bail will exceed its utility to the Prison Industrial Complex.  
      </p>


      <p>
      Bail equates cash with freedom.
      </p>

      <p>Bail Bloc breaks the system.</p>

    <ol>
      <div align="left">
      <li id="bail">Bail is an amount of money that courts require of the recently arrested in exchange for their immediate-term freedom. For those who can afford it, posting bail allows defendants to avoid incarceration for the weeks or months that typically stretch between the point of arrest and the court date. <a href="#footnotes-ref" aria-label="Back to content">↩</a></li>
<br/>
      <li id="monero">For example, a user is able to purchase a baseball hat on the internet for 0.00122 Bitcoin (or 0.0877 Monero) from participating vendors, such as Overstock.com. That same hat is could also be bought for $5 USD. This means 0.00122 Bitcoins is worth $5 USD, and can be exchanged for that amount.<a href="#footnotes-ref" aria-label="Back to content">↩</a></li></div>
