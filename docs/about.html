      <h1>About Bail Bloc</h1>

      <div class="margin-right">
        1. Bail is an amount of money that courts require people who have been recently arrested to pay in exchange for their release from jail in the weeks or months they must wait before they’re scheduled to stand trial.
        <br><br>
        2. See our <a href="tips.html">Tips section</a> to learn how you can expedite this process.
      </div>

      <p>
        <strong>Here’s how it works:</strong> When you download the app, a small part of your computer's unused processing power is redirected toward mining a cryptocurrency called <a href="https://getmonero.org/">Monero</a>. At the end of every month, we exchange the Monero for US dollars and donate the earnings to the <a href="http://www.thebronxfreedomfund.org/">Bronx Freedom Fund</a>, a nonprofit charitable bail fund.<sup>1</sup>
      </p>

      <p>100% of the currency your computer generates is used by the Bronx Freedom Fund to directly post bail for low-income people charged with minor offenses, and help targeted communities endure the most immediate effects of policing. </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Bail funds accumulate:</strong> Bail funds are “revolving,” which means they’re returned to their source when a defendant makes trial—which happens 94% of the time. very small contribution accumulates over time.
      </p>

      <p>
        Most Bail Bloc users can expect to generate around $3 to $5 per month. It might not seem like much, but because of revolving bail, it adds up quickly.<sup>2</sup> In just a month, 1000 users running Bail Bloc can make enough money to free X people.
      </p>


      <h2>
        HOW BAIL WORKS
      </h2>
      <p>BAIL HAS NO REAL JUSTIFICATION, BUT IT PUTS REAL PEOPLE IN PRISON.</p>

      <div class="margin-right">
        3. In 72% of cases where bail is set, it is for $1,000 or less. 87% of defendants are unable to pay and must serve pre-trial jail time, which means that the loss of a job, eviction, or deportation is likely. Defendants who are unable to afford bail 9x more likely to plead guilty than those who can afford bail. According to the Guardian, [link] 99.6% of misdemeanor convictions in the United States come from plea deals.
      </div>

      <p>
        Bail systematically penalizes the poor who cannot afford bail or to stay in jail, leading many people to take guilty plea deals without a trial in exchange for their release.<sup>3</sup> That means they are never allowed to argue their case and can never be found innocent. These defendants, put simply, are found guilty of poverty.
      </p>

      <p>
        The American criminal justice system is unequipped to try the number of defendants it charges, which is why prosecutors systemically coerce defendants to plead guilty. These forced plea deals intensify mass incarceration by relieving courts of the burden of litigation.
      </p>

      <p>
        In other words: Bail is a means to an end, and the end is mass incarceration.
      </p>





      <h2>WHAT IS CRYPTOCURRENCY?</h2>
      <p>
        CRYPTOCURRENCY ISN'T REAL MONEY, BUT IT HAS REAL-WORLD EXCHANGE VALUE.
      </p>

      <div class="margin-right">
        4. For example, a user is able to purchase a baseball hat on the internet for 0.00122 Bitcoin from participating vendors, such as Overstock.com. That same hat is could also be bought for $5 USD. This means 0.00122 Bitcoins is worth $5 USD, and can be exchanged for that amount.
      </div>

      <p>
        Just as the US Treasury prints money to infuse into the economy, cryptocurrency is generated "out of nowhere" through an arbitrary process. But where the US Treasury needs a minting machine, all miners need is computing power. Cryptocurrencies , are generated through users running software to solve difficult computational problems. This process is called "mining." When a problem is solved, the user is rewarded by a decentralized cryptocurrency network with units of that cryptocurrency. If enough users mine for the same cryptocurrency, it begins to have an exchange value.<sup>4</sup>

      <h2>OUR GOAL</h2>
      <p>
        BAIL BLOC IS DESIGNED TO PUT PRESSURE ON COURTS AND BRING AN END TO BAIL.

        <em>"If everyone charged with crimes suddenly exercised his constitutional rights, there would not be enough judges, lawyers or prison cells to deal with the ensuing tsunami of litigation.”</em> – Michelle Alexander, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/11/opinion/sunday/go-to-trial-crash-the-justice-system.html">The New York Times</a>

      <p>
        With enough downloads, Bail Bloc has the potential to release a critical mass of defendants from jail, revealing what is, for many, a counter-intuitive reality: The Prison Industrial Complex is not an economic inevitability.
      </p>


      <p>
      Whether or not U.S. courts are able to offer due process for all citizens without breaking under the weight of their own incarceral excess remains to be seen.<sup>5</sup>
